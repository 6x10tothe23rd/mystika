# Mystica

The Mystika project seeks to deliver an industrial quality, high-performance cryptographic library with forward-looking features and very high-level code. The idea is to deliver a cryptographic foundation for critical software that consists of a small, efficient, and easy to audit code based built on very high-level coding practices. Here are some key goals:

* Demonstrably Reliable
* Safe and future-worthy cryptography only
* Protocol level compatibility with existing standards when possible
* Easy to use
